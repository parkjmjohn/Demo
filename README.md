Project Title
Masher


Project Idea:
Create a single player musical game
Example of games this is similar to: Smule, Tap Tap, Guitar Hero

Objective of Masher is to have the player press the keys in succession with rhythm to a melody
There will be scoreboard that accounts for:
Streaks
Faults
Double keys
There will be different songs to choose from based on the player’s taste

Critical Features:
1.      Have a way to track multiple keys being pressed at the same time.
a. Chords and other combinations of notes will be implemented requiring the player to hit multiple keys at the same time.
 
2.      Soundtrack.
a. This will be the melody which the player will “play” to.
 
3.      Generating beats and continuous notes.
a.  The issue of whether notes will be randomly generated or created based on the attributes (tempo, pitch, etc) of the soundtrack. 

To be Added Later Features:
Different types of level, for the weak and the athletics
This scoreboard is associated with the audience’s zing, which at the end would give you money
Having cash would allow you to have access to more songs

Developmental Stages:
1.      Create an array of notes designated to a “key” that adds more notes when played.
 
2.      Find a way to generate the graphics for the notes moving down the screen and have a separate symbol for continuous notes.
 
3.      Code the registering of keys pressed/held for periods of time.
 
4.      Figure out some animation to go with pressing the keys correctly with the notes on the screen.
 
5.      Add the soundtrack. If possible match the motion of the notes with the tempo/pitch of the song.
 
6.      Have some sort of background on the screen. Add a homepage/start page. 

The minimum product of this project would be a version that only include one song, and that will have a scoreboard that account for successions with the melody. No homepage or any other features.
